### Purpose
This project was created to streamline the organizational efforts of the Rock River Anything That Floats Race. Running on NodeJS, this project displays a powerful web interface where administrators can manage raft information, conduct raft timing, and display results to the public. A smart timing plugin and a custom web voting limiter for the People's Choice Award were both built in-house and from scratch by myself. This manager is now live at [rratfr.rakerman.com](https://rratfr.rakerman.com) and has been in use since 2019.
